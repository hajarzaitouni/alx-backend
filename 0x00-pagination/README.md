# 0x00. Pagination
This project is part of the alx-backend repository. It focuses on implementing various pagination techniques for datasets. The objectives of this project include:

1. Paginating a dataset with simple page and page_size parameters.
2. Paginating a dataset with hypermedia metadata.
3. Paginating in a deletion-resilient manner.

## Objectives:

* __Paginate with Simple Parameters__: Implement functions to paginate a dataset using basic page and page_size parameters.
* __Hypermedia Pagination__: Add hypermedia metadata to the pagination, providing additional context such as total pages, current page, next page, and previous page.
* __Deletion-Resilient Pagination__: Ensure pagination remains consistent even when items are deleted from the dataset.
